Remember to `source env/bin/activate` in the root of the project, before start a python project.
For the database `python manage.py makemigrations` & `python manage.py migrate`.

Go to directory `backend`, then start server with command `python manage.py runserver`.

For React.js code, `cd frontend`, `npm install`, and `npm run dev`.
